- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @larasacodes aka Lara Amusan
- :desktop_computer: My journey into coding started through conducting data analysis projects during my time studying Astrophysics at University. Since then I have been building my skills in my spare time, and have set up a GitHub profile to share all that I have learnt and will learn in the furture!
- :briefcase: I currently work in IT Audit at a Big 4 company and have contributed to efforts to drive innovation by being a part of the Cloud Team. My most recent achievement whilst in this team has been successfully completing my AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner qualification.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the multiple ways Python can be leveraged to build smart solutions. As part of the Code First Girls Python & Apps course (completed November 2023), my team built a movie recommendation app using 2 APIs through Python and HTML code. This app gained us the project prize, and I also decideed to continue learning by creating projects in my spare time based on the alternative breifs given (based on data and gaming)!
- ðŸš€ Coding helps fuel my curious mind and I find joy in building fun and interesting applications/data visuals, using the tools i've learnt from courses along the way. 
- ðŸ˜„ Welcome to my page!
